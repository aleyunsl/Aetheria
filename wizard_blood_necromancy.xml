      <p>The Blood Necromancer tradition channels forbidden blood magic to transform your magical recovery and combat abilities.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong>Sacrificial Recovery (Level 1):</strong> Replace standard Arcane Recovery. After a short rest, recover expended spell slots by converting hit diceâ€”at the cost of necrotic damage (2d6 for a 1st-level slot, 3d6 for a 2nd-level slot, etc.).</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong>The Cycle of Blood and Death (Level 2):</strong> When you kill a creature with a Necromancy spell, necrotic energy lashes out to deal damage equal to your proficiency bonus to another creature within 60 feet. Alternatively, if you kill a creature with a Hemomancy spell, a friendly creature within 60 feet regains hit points equal to twice your proficiency bonus. Also, add your Intelligence modifier (minimum +1) to spells of 1st level or higher.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong>Bloodletting Curse (Level 2):</strong> As a bonus action, curse a creature within 60 feet for 1 minute. On its turn, the first time it takes necrotic damage, it suffers an extra 2d4 necrotic damage. (At higher levels, additional uses and increased damage occur.)</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong>Sanguine Echo (Level 6):</strong> When you deal necrotic damage with a spell, you can use your reaction to add 1d6 per spell level to the damage. This bonus damage ignores necrotic resistance but not immunity. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum once), regaining all uses after a long rest.</p>
