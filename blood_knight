  <!-- Blood Knight Class -->
  <element name="Blood Knight" type="Class" source="Homebrew" id="ID_CUSTOM_CLASS_BLOOD_KNIGHT">
    <description>
      <p>The Blood Knight is a warrior who channels the forbidden power of hemocraft – sacrificing a portion of their own life force to fuel devastating combat abilities. Through ancient blood rituals, you gain a pool of hemocraft dice that empower unique abilities such as Life Transfer, Rend, and Adrenaline Surge.</p>
      <p class="indent">When creating a Blood Knight, your Constitution is paramount, as it determines both your vitality and the size of your hemocraft pool.</p>
